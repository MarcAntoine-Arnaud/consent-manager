# Consent Manager
The Prometheus-X Consent Manager is a service for managing consent within the Prometheus-X ecosystem. It empowers ecosystem administrators to oversee and enforce consent agreements, data/service providers to adhere to consent regulations, and users to manage their consent preferences seamlessly.

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Prometheus-X-association/consent-manager.git
cd consent-manager
npm install
cp .env.sample .env
# Configure your environment variables in .env
```

The consent manager is a work in progress, evolving alongside developments of the Contract and Catalog components of the Prometheus-X Ecosystem.
